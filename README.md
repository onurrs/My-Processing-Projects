## Introduction
Processing is a powerful programming language that shares similarities with Java. However, it is specifically designed for visual arts and creative coding. The main goal of this repository is to explore various algorithmic problems and demonstrate their visual representation using Processing.

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, follow these installation steps:
1. Make sure you have Processing installed on your system. If not, you can download it from the official website: [processing.org](https://processing.org/download)
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/My-Processing-Projects.git

3. Open Processing and navigate to the cloned repository.

## Usage
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:
1. Open the desired project file in Processing.
2. Review the code and understand the implemented algorithm or problem.
3. Run the code to visualize the results.

## Examples
Here are a few examples of the projects you can find in this repository:
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Visualizations of various sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Merge Sort. These visualizations demonstrate the step-by-step sorting process, making it easier to understand the algorithms.
- **Function Visualizer**: Visualizations of functions on a coordinate plane.

Feel free to explore the repository and try out different projects to gain a better understanding of the algorithms and their visual representations.
